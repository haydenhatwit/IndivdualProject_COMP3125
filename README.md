# IndividualProject_COMP3125

This project looks at how different lifestyle factors affect whether a student passes or fails, using the Student Performance Dataset from UCI. I focused on things like study time, internet access, family support, and alcohol use to see which ones impact grades the most. I used both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to make predictions and compared how well they did using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores. The repo has my code, dataset, graphs, and the full project report.
